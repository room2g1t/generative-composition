# generative-composition


 I used the a* pathfinding algorithm, euclidean algorithm and L system for this project. A* algorithm is usually used to search the fastest way to solve a problem, and I used the x and y axis of the node to run through euclidean rhythm and L system to generate different numbers. I mainly divided the composition to three parts where it’s more minimal at the end and begin and more rhythmic and glitchy in the middle. 
  
  I loaded some sound that I made last year and selected different ranges to trigger them. For example, the whole map is 60x60, if x is between 30-50, then it’s in the range of clicking sine wave, and so if the input is 35, then the sine wave will play through. I also selected certain spot such as 5, 10, 15… so if the input matches it will trigger the fm sound. I also made some sound stereo that if the input is odd number then left channel else it will be the right channel.
 
 I found it interesting that sometimes it won’t trigger all the sound and sometimes it triggers various different sound in a very short time. And it’s also interesting playing with the slider to change the speed, and if the player set the frame rate to 0.0001, it could really be stretched to an almost endless time to finish.
